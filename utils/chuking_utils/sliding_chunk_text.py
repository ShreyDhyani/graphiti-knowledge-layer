    Sliding-window chunker with overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text:
        Input string.
    chunk_chars:
        Target size (chars) of each chunk window.
    overlap_chars:
        How many characters to overlap between adjacent chunks.
    preserve_sentences:
        If True, prefer to end a chunk at a sentence boundary within a
        small lookahead window. Otherwise it will split roughly at chunk_chars.
    min_chunk_size:
        Minimum allowed chunk length. If None, defaults to chunk_chars // 4.

    Behavior
    --------
    - Produces chunks by moving a sliding window of size `chunk_chars`.
    - After yielding a chunk, the next window starts at `end - overlap_chars`.
    - Tries not to split sentences (if preserve_sentences) by extending `end` into
      a small lookahead to the next sentence end (period/question/exclamation or newline).
    - Tries not to split words by backing off a little when cutting in the middle of a word.
